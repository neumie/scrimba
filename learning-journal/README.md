# Learning journal

This is the third solo project at Scrimba's "Frontend Developer Career Path"
live demo: https://neumie-learning-journal.netlify.app/

## Description

This solo project aims to practice the skills that Module 6 (responsive design) taught us.
One of which is using responsive units that adapt to other content.
Next we were introduced to grid layout.
And last but not least, we started using media queries to change the way websites display their layout depending on the size of the browser.
